# AgriConnect

AgriConnect is a comprehensive digital marketplace platform designed to connect farmers directly with buyers, eliminating middlemen and ensuring fair prices for agricultural products.

## Key Innovation: Voice-Based Intelligent Assistant

**AgriConnect's voice-based chatbot** is a groundbreaking feature that revolutionizes how farmers interact with technology:

- **Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech**: Allows farmers with limited literacy to use voice commands in their native language

- **Multilingual Support**: Operates in English, Hindi, and Telugu to serve diverse rural communities
- **Function-Rich Interface**: Performs complex tasks like product management and order tracking through simple voice instructions

This technology bridges the digital divide for rural farmers who may have limited literacy or technical skills, making advanced e-commerce accessible to all.
